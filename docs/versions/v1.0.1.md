# Version 1.0.1: Enhanced Data Validation & Reporting

**Release Date:** January 5, 2026

We are excited to announce **Version 1.0.1** of Content Atlas! This release focuses on significantly improving data integrity through robust validation tools and providing deeper visibility into your data import process with enhanced error reporting.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 22 New Preset Validators
We've added a comprehensive library of **22 preset regex validators** to ensure your data is clean and consistent from the moment it enters the system. You can now validate:

*   **Contact Info:** Email, Phone (US, International, Loose), Postal Codes (US, CA).
*   **Financial Data:** Credit Cards, Currency (USD), IBAN.
*   **Identifiers:** UUID, SSN, EIN.
*   **Web & Network:** URLs, Domains, IPv4, IPv6.
*   **Formats:** Dates (ISO, US), Times (24h), Hex Colors, Slugs.
*   **Business:** SKUs, Alphanumeric IDs.

### 2. Intelligent Validation Selection
Our LLM-powered mapping engine has been upgraded to **automatically detect and suggest** the most appropriate validators for your columns. It analyzes your data context and recommends the right rules (e.g., suggesting "Email" validation for a column named "Contact Email"), saving you setup time and reducing errors.

### 3. Enhanced Error & Duplicate Reporting
We've overhauled how we handle and report data issues:
*   **Duplicate Detection:** New detailed reporting on duplicate records, including optimized file sampling for faster checks.
*   **Validation Failures:** New API endpoints allow you to retrieve specific validation failures and mapping errors, giving you granular control over data quality.

## 🛠 API & Technical Improvements

*   **New Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /import-history/{import_id}/mapping-errors`
    *   `GET /import-history/{import_id}/validation-failures`
*   **Schema Cleanup:** Removed deprecated Workflow-related schemas to keep the API surface clean and focused.
*   **Performance:** Optimized file sampling for duplicate detection.
